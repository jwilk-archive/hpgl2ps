       This  filter  is  used  to convert Hewlett Packard Graphic
       Language (HP-GL) 7550A plotter commands to PostScript. The
       HP-GL  commands are a subset of the Roland plotter command
       set (RD-GL).

       The default conditions for hhppggll22ppss are:

       AA..     The plot translation is  from  an  ANSI  A  (8.5  x
              11inch)  plot  to  ANSI A paper on the LaserWriter.
              See below for other paper sizes.

       BB..     Line thicknesses are in  millimeters  and  are  for
              lines  (pens)  1  to  9: (0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1,
              0.2, 0.4, 0.5 1.0 2.0)

       CC..     The default font is  Helvetica,  14  point  on  the
              Laserwriter.

       DD..     The  default  font height and width multipliers are
              1.2 and 3.6 respectively.

       NNoottee::  If the plotfile  is  not  specified  then  standard
              input is assumed.

       --44     Draw  for an A4 ISO (297mm x 210mm) plot. This will
              give an aproximate 1:1 translation  to  the  Laser-
              Writer.

       --33     Draw for an A3 ISO (420mm x 297mm) plot.

              When  the  SR command exists in the HP-GL file, the
              size of characters is scaled to be a proportion  of
              the paper dimensions.  The HP7550 plotter character
              sizes are larger than the  scaling  suggests.   The
              default  value of the font height multiplier scales
              the characters in the  postscript  file  to  appear
              roughly the same width as the original.  Setting to

              The PostScript printer will print  any  text/labels
              out  with  the Courier font. That can be changed to
              any of the standard font names in this list:

              HHeellvveettiiccaa

              plus any other fonts your postscript printer may be
              able  to  handle.   There  is  no error checking to
              limit the font names to the standard Adobe base 35.
              On  the other hand, because we have left this open-
              ended for your maximum flexibility in this way, you
              will  also  pay  a price: if you give the -f flag a
              font name which your printer  does  not  recognize,
              then have fun with the results.

       --ll _l_i_n_e _s_i_z_e_s
              This  option  allows  the  default line sizes to be
              replaced with different sizes  starting  from  line
              (pen)  one  through  nine.  The  new sizes (real or
              integer) are entered in a  comma  separated  string
              (_l_i_n_e  _s_i_z_e) and are in millimeters. Only the sizes
              entered in the string will be changed with  respect
              to  lines  (pens) one to nine while nonentered line
              (pen) sizes will retain the default sizes.

              In the following example only the first three sizes
              will be changed.

              eg: hpgl2ps -l 0.4,0.3,1 file | lpr -Plaser1

       --mm     Enable  the  manual feed on the LaserWriter (cutoff
              time 3 minutes).

       --rr     Rotate plot(s) through 90  degrees.  (The  plot  is
              made smaller)

       --ss _s_c_a_l_e
              Scale  the  plot  from  0.1 to 3 times its original
              size.

       --vv     Print out version number and usage.

              When the SR command exists in the HP-GL  file,  the
              size  of characters is scaled to be a proportion of
              the paper dimensions.  The HP7550 plotter character
              sizes  are  larger  than the scaling suggests.  The
              default value of the font width  multiplier  scales
              the  characters  in  the  postscript file to appear
              roughly the same width as the original.  Setting to
              1.0 reverts to the original scaling.

       --xx _o_f_f_s_e_t
              Place an X offset (in mm) in the plot.

       --yy _o_f_f_s_e_t
              Place an Y offset (in mm) in the plot.

       NNoottee:: Offsets are with respect to the 0, 0 (origin) of the
       HP-GL / RD-GL plotting commands, thus if the minimum plot-
       ting coordinates are below either the X and/or Y zero axis
       then a positive offset is applied.  Similarly if the mini-
       mum  plot  coordinates  are above the X and/or Y zero axis
       then a negative offset is applied.

       Some of the graphics  commands  are  unimplemented  and  a
       warning  will  be displayed. If this command is vital then
       it must be written into the code.

       No interactive command is suported.
