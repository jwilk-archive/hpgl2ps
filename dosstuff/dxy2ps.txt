       This filter is used to convert  the  Roland  DXY  and  the
       Roland  Graphics  Language (RD-GL) (which is a superset of
       the Hewlett Packard Graphics Language (HP-GL)) commands to
       PostScript.

       The RD-GL commands are only operated on if each command is
       prefixed with a "^", therfore if your plotfile  only  con-
       tains HP-GL or RD-GL commands use the filter hhppggll22ppss.

       The default conditions for ddxxyy22ppss are:

       11..     The plot translation is from ISO A3 (420mm x 297mm)
              to ISO A4 (297mm x 210mm) on the LaserWriter.

       22..     Line thicknesses are in  millimeters  and  are  for
              lines  (pens)  1  to  9: ( 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
              0.7, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 )

       NNoottee::  If the plotfile  is  not  specified  then  standard
              input is assumed.

       --aa     Draw  on  an A4 ISO (297mm x 210mm) sheet of paper.
              This will give an aproximate 1:1 translation to the
              LaserWriter.

              The  PostScript  printer will print any text/labels
              out with the Courier font. That can be  changed  to
              any of the standard font names in this list:

              HHeellvveettiiccaa

              plus any other fonts your postscript printer may be
              able to handle.  There  is  no  error  checking  to
              limit the font names to the standard Adobe base 35.
              On the other hand, because we have left this  open-
              ended for your maximum flexibility in this way, you
              will also pay a price: if you give the  -f  flag  a
              font  name  which  your printer does not recognize,
              then have fun with the results.

       --ll _l_i_n_e _s_i_z_e_s
              This option allows the default  line  sizes  to  be
              replaced  with  different  sizes starting from line
              (pen) one through nine.  The  new  sizes  (real  or

              integer)  are  entered  in a comma seperated string
              (_l_i_n_e _s_i_z_e) and are in millimeters. Only the  sizes
              entered  in the string will be changed with respect
              to lines (pens) one to nine while  nonentered  line
              (pen) sizes will retain the default sizes.

              In the following example only the first three sizes
              will be changed.

              eg: dxy2ps -l 0.4,0.3,1 file | lpr -Plaser1

       --mm     Enable the manual feed on the  LaserWriter  (cutoff
              time 3 minutes).

       --rr     Rotate  plot(s)  through  90  degrees. (The plot is
              made smaller)

       --vv     Print out version number and usage.

       --ss _s_c_a_l_e
              Scale the plot from 0.1 to  3  times  its  original
              size.

       --xx _o_f_f_s_e_t
              Place an X offset (in mm) in the plot.

       --yy _o_f_f_s_e_t
              Place an Y offset (in mm) in the plot.

       NNoottee:: Offsets are with respect to the 0, 0 (origin) of the
       HP-GL / RD-GL plotting commands, thus if the minimum plot-
       ting coordinates are below either the X and/or Y zero axis
       then a positive offset is applied.  Similarly if the mini-
       mum  plot  coordinates  are above the X and/or Y zero axis
       then a negative offset is applied.

       Some of the graphics  commands  are  unimplemented  and  a
       warning  will  be displayed. If this command is vital then
       it must be written into the code.

       No interactive command is suported.
